title:  "Comparing APK sizes"

For apps in Flutter, React Native, Kotlin and Java

There are so many ways to make mobile apps ranging from direct platform specific development (using *Java* and *Kotlin* for Android, and *ObjC* and *Swift* for iOS), there’s *React Native* from Facebook, [Electrode Native](http://www.electrode.io/site/native.html) from Walmart, the *Ionic* framework, *Unity* for certain types of apps, and the [flutter.io](https://flutter.io/) framework which was [just released by Google](https://medium.com/flutter-io/announcing-flutter-beta-1-build-beautiful-native-apps-dc142aea74c0).

Ever wondered how these libraries and frameworks affect the size of your app? Let’s analyze some apk files for apps written in some of these ways. The apps are very basic, containing just a title at the top and a text at the center of the screen. This will show, for a bare minimum app what these frameworks need to package along with the apk for it to be able to run.

*Simple Hello World app*

* For this test I created four different versions of the app, one in each of Java, Kotlin, React Native, and Flutter. (Android API 27)

* The apks were then published for *release* type using Android Studio for *Java* and *Kotlin* and using the cli for *React Native* and *Flutter*.

* Default proguard configuration was used. (Minification was enabled)

* The apks were analyzed using the *Analyze APK* feature in Android Studio.

## Java (539 KB)

Lets start with the simplest one — *Java*. As you would expect this would be the smallest in size given that we are using just Java and the Android framework to create this app, with the only dependency being the Android Support Library, which you can see here takes up quite a lot of space.

We could potentially bring the app size down by removing this only dependency and using [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html) instead of [AppCompatActivity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/app/AppCompatActivity.html).

## Kotlin (550 KB)

Next up, the fancy kid on the block — *Kotlin*. If you have been coding a long time in *Java*, *Kotlin* is a breath of fresh air. The release apk for the Kotlin app comprises of everything that we saw in the Java apk, plus a tiny portion of *Kotlin* based syntactic sugar info.

## React Native (7 MB)

If you are coming from the web world and want to do *most* of the mobile development using javascript *React Native* is your go to option. It is also helpful if you want to iterate faster on a feature without releasing the app for every little change.

The release apk generated by *React Native* has a few classes in the `classes.dex` file that have 12193 referenced methods for this particular app.

It also adds some native dependencies in the `lib` directory for *x86* and *armeabi-v7a*. Adding up to around 6.4 MB of dependencies in total.

## Flutter (7.5 MB)
> **Update**: Minimal APK sizes for Flutter applications went down!! *“Overall release APKs are now 2MB smaller with those improvements. This brings the release APK size of a [minimal Flutter app](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/60d223c20c44424e3c8031d019270d22bab35df6/examples/hello_world) down to 4.7MB (from previously 6.7MB)”. — [https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16833#issuecomment-410103493](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16833#issuecomment-410103493)*

The release app generated by *Flutter*’s cli contains the C/C++ engine and the Dart VM which makes up almost all the of the apk. The app directly runs using the native instruction set and no interpreter is involved.

Every method of writing the app has its pros and cons (a future post will debate the pros/cons for each of these). Choose the method that makes the most sense for your use case and for your company. You can also mix and match some of these frameworks to make different parts of your app.

For example, if you are experimenting something make that component in *React Native,* if you want to share code between the iOS and Android app look into either *React Native* or *Flutter*, and if you are just focusing on Android and keeping the app size to a minimum is very critical you can go with either *Java* or *Kotlin.*
